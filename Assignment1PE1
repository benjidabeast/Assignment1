<p> I am reading this book to learn how to develop websites that can<br>

be accessedfrom any device and can serve as cross-platform<br>
apps.<br>
The devices I will test will be running the following operating<br>
systems.<br><br>

Apple iOS<br>
Google Android<br>
Blackberry OS<br>
Microsoft Windows Phone OS<br>

Get an account from your system administrator and upload your web page to your <br> account.
